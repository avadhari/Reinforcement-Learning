# Reinforcement-Learning

Reinforcement Learning using Q Learning Algorithm on the Stock Trading Environment of NVIDIA Stock for the span of 5 Years, the agent has three possible actions to do Buy/Sell/Hold at each instance, the agent has initial $100,000 as capital and goal is to have return of investment of atleast $20,000 over the span of few days.

The agent is first trained and then with series of explorations and exploitations the agent trades to get the maximum possible profit.

The Environment was already given by the professor, I was expected to implement the Q Functions from scratch and evaluate the model and lastly plot all the graphs of capital increase, epsilon decay and reward change over the epochs.

As a part of CSE 574 Intro to Machine Learning Project Assignment.
